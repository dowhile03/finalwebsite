        <h2>Seriously, 1 Billion dollars every year to Amazon? Is that what you are thinking? But why?
        </h2> <br>
        <p class="font1">As most of the people around us are aware of these two big business giants: NETFLIX and AMAZON, 
            as two different companies who are dealing in a totally different niche. Amazon is an online shopping stop, 
            where we can find almost everything we want, no matter where you are around the globe. While Netflix is an 
            entertainment platform that allows its members to watch TV shows and movies without commercials. And if you think
             the same then you are completely right! But what if I tell you that what you think of Amazon and Netflix as
              independent companies and no link in between is wrong? And Amazon has played a major role in growing Netflix? But how, right?
              <br>
              Alright, now I will try to explain to you how they are linked to each other and why Netflix pays such a huge amount to Amazon. But before we directly jump to Why, there are a few things that you need to understand to get a clearer view of the real-picture!

        </p>
        <h2><i>“Netflix has 73.94 million paying subscribers based in the US & Canada”</i></h2>
        <p class="font1">
            As of now, we all are aware that these two giants are internet based service providers and have a huge audience around the globe. Both the companies are the best in their niche in almost every possible way! And one of the major factors that plays a massive role in the development of these giants today is the technology they are using. As a customer, of course we usually don't get into the technical stuff running behind the scene unless you are a tech enthusiast. But right now if you have landed here, I suppose you have keen interest in reading, and gaining knowledge about the services that have been ruling since the past few years! And you don't need to be a technical person to understand why Netflix pays so much of an amount to Amazon.
        <br> <br>
        So firstly, I would like to clarify your idea about Amazon. Amazon has multiple companies and provides multiple services. A few common ones are the amazon app/ webapps that we use for ordering stuff, Amazon prime which is an entertainment based service and so on. And then there is AWS, which is Amazon Web Services, which provides on demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
        </p> <br>

        <img src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20200513005022/en/791013/23/AWS_logo_RGB.jpg" class="imageBlog" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Crypto coin">

        <p class="font1">In simple words, AWS provides instances, servers and lots of other resources on cloud for many companies as AWS is one of the biggest cloud providers in the commercial domain in the industry. And among the rest of the other clients, Netflix is one of the biggest users of AWS.
        </p> <br><br>


        <p class="font1">Netflix uses AWS for nearly all its computing and storage needs, including databases, analytics, recommendation engines, video transcoding, and over a hundred other functions that in total it uses more than 100,000 server instances on AWS.
       

        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h1>The Calculation behind 1 Billion Dollars:
        </h1>
        <p class="font1">Let’s start by looking at how many users Netflix has: 208 million. Let’s assume that every customer, paying a monthly fee, is watching on average at least 1, maybe 1.5 hours a day (can include passive watching on the couch in the evening and while Netflix and chill trend).
        </p>
        <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/3O56YW3LLFOUZGZOFDVAM4GSJE.jpg" class="imageBlog" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Crypto coin">
        <br><br>
    
       <p class="font1">
       
Let’s take 1.5 hours as a measure, which is proved by some statistics on Google. That means, that Netflix content is streamed 1.5*208,000,000 hours per day, which comes to 312,000,000 hours per day or 2,184,000,000hours per week. 
Let’s look at the streaming size per minute. When watching in standard 360p, the computer streams about 250MB per hour, or 4.2MB per minute. Compared to watching the stream in Full HD, the download rate is approximately 20MB per minute. 
Let’s assume that between mobile, computer and TV streaming customers, the average definition is at 720p. Thus we have a download size of about 850MB / 0.85 GB per hour of streamed content. That means, Netflix has an AWS data traffic, only for streaming, of 1 billion GB per week. That's 1,000 Petabytes, to make the number more readable.. We will leave data streaming used for their website and trailers and video previews out of the picture, as this would be minor compared to the actual streaming volume.
 </p><br><br>

        <p class="font1">Let’s look at what AWS charges for their services, assuming that Netflix is charged as a normal customer. I’ll leave out the cost approximation for the storage volume, as I find it nearly impossible to properly guess the amount of content Netflix offers.
            <br>
            For large companies, AWS charges $0.021 per transferred GB per month. As we calculated above, Netflix transfers about 1 billion GB of data to their customers per week, thus 4 billion GB of data per month. That makes a beautiful bill of $84 million per month, or $1 billion per year. With a yearly revenue of about $15 billion, the servers cost Netflix about 7% of their total volume, which can be considered very cheap, as Netflix’s largest cost factor, besides their Original series, are their server and streaming costs.
        </p><br><br>
        <h1>Let's Wrap it up</h1>
        <h3><i>“Despite more competition, Netflix still has the largest subscriber count in 2021”</i></h3>
        <img src="https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amazon-Data-Science-1024x683.jpeg" class="imageBlog" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Crypto coin">


        <p class="font1">Amazon is a prominent name among some cloud services providers. It has a wide variety of services with which it keeps experimenting for finding another innovative way for developers and entrepreneurs. Their culture of modification and renewal of old active items with new fresh ideas and functions. It has become an excellent platform for all developers. You may call it a heaven for them.
            <br><br>
            While Netflix is just growing and getting huge in the entertainment niche. The high quality content, no advertisements, the reliability, the collection and so on just improve every single day making it the world's biggest entertainment platform.
            <br><br>
            I hope now you understand the story behind NETFLIX and Amazon that I was talking about. The calculation might not be perfect, but now we know there is a huge pay from Netflix to AWS as a user. In different articles and as per different surveys, we might come up with some random calculations and they are definitely not the exact amount involved. The calculation above is an approx value as per the calculation.
            <br><br>
            Well, as per the surveys and research these industries are expanding at an enormous rate and will multiply itself into a huge number by the end of 2025.
       <br><br>
