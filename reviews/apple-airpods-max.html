          <h3>Detailed description : </h3> <br><br>
        <p class="font1">
            The Apple AirPods Max are the most hotly-anticipated headphones of 2020, having been the subject
            of rumor and speculation for two years. And now when they are finally out they have really created
            a hype in the market about themselves. So lets first take a look about the positive side of these
            headphones.
            The main highlight right from the moment you take it in your hands is its build quality, its
            made from stainless steel which means that it feels slightly heavy but it doesn’t feel so when
            you wear it, thanks to its super stable weight balance. They do look rather special compared
            to the competition, with a build quality that feels suitably premium for the price. Apple
            AirPods Max come with a headband made from a knitted mesh fabric that's designed to
            reduce on-head pressure. It comes with brighter color options, which include, silver, sky
            blue, green, and pink. Then comes one of the best thing this headphone has when
            compared to any other option available in the market i.e., its noise cancellation feature. The
            noise cancellation provided by the Apple AirPods Max is very strong, and we'd say it's on par
            with its competitors. Each ear cup features three outward-facing microphones to detect
            environmental noise, while one microphone inside the ear cup monitors the sound reaching
            your ear. Apple says the AirPods Max use computational audio to continuously adapt their
            noise cancellation performance based on "the headphone fit and movement in real time".

            Like the AirPods and AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max come with the Apple H1 chip in each
            earcup, which features no less than 10 audio cores to allow for Adaptive EQ, active noise
            cancellation, Transparency mode, and Spatial Audio. Released as part of iOS 14, the Spatial
            Audio feature first came to the AirPods Pro, and works for content in 5.1, 7.1 and Dolby
            Atmos, which positions sound all around you within a virtual sphere.
            If we talk about the sound quality of the headphones we can surely say that no easily out
            beat the competition. The audio quality offered by the Apple AirPods Max is simply
            outstanding. They come with a wide, well-balanced soundstage that leaves plenty of room
            for each instrument to really sing – pair that with cool extra features like automatically
            pausing your music when you remove the headphones and Spatial Audio, and you've got
            yourself a very special pair of cans.
            Apple says the AirPods Max provide up to 20 hours of high-fidelity audio, talk time, or movie
            playback, which ordinarily wouldn't seem a huge amount; however, given that this is with
            Active Noise Cancellation enabled, it's a pretty respectable figure.The best over-ear
            headphones will usually hit around 30 hours of battery life, although many very good
            models only make it to around 20 – either way it's enough for a full day or two's use,
            depending on how wedded they'll be to your ears. Connectivity comes courtesy of
            Bluetooth 5, and as such, pairing is fast and stable.
